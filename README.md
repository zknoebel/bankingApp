    Task: Produce a financial program that tracks the balances of multiple users and supports multiple currencies. This will be done in stages.
    Detail: Produce a command-line driven financial calculator that supports multiple currencies. The program should be capable of adding and subtracting values from a user’s account. The program should handle conversion of the currencies prior to the arithmetic operation. The program should include commands:
    MAINT – Allow currency conversion data to be entered (or read in)
    Create regular expressions to validate all input to include commands, usernames, currency types, and currency values. For currency values, validation should be consistent with the standards used to write numbers in the currency being used. (e.g. $3,150.02, £10.52, etc.). Be sure to document your assumptions for formats in your report. 
    Accepting ambiguous currency values is acceptable as long as you handle the ambiguity reasonably
    You must accept at least three unique currencies (e.g. USD, UK Pound, Euro). You must include functions that allow conversion values to be input for the currencies that you will support.
    You must gracefully reject any attempts to provide invalid data.
    The database of currencies should persist between executions of the program.
    Permissible languages: C/C++, Java, Python, or Other with permission of instructor. No Shell Scripts
    Output:
